 URLSession is a replacement API for URLConnection.  It provides
 options that affect the policy of, and various aspects of the
 mechanism by which NSURLRequest objects are retrieved from the
 network.
 
 An URLSession may be bound to a delegate object.  The delegate is
 invoked for certain events during the lifetime of a session, such as
 server authentication or determining whether a resource to be loaded
 should be converted into a download.
 
 URLSession instances are threadsafe.
 
 The default URLSession uses a system provided delegate and is
 appropriate to use in place of existing code that uses
 +[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:queue:completionHandler:]
 
 An URLSession creates URLSessionTask objects which represent the
 action of a resource being loaded.  These are analogous to
 NSURLConnection objects but provide for more control and a unified
 delegate model.
 
 URLSessionTask objects are always created in a suspended state and
 must be sent the -resume message before they will execute.
 
 Subclasses of URLSessionTask are used to syntactically
 differentiate between data and file downloads.
 
 An URLSessionDataTask receives the resource as a series of calls to
 the URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveData: delegate method.  This is type of
 task most commonly associated with retrieving objects for immediate parsing
 by the consumer.
 
 An URLSessionUploadTask differs from an URLSessionDataTask
 in how its instance is constructed.  Upload tasks are explicitly created
 by referencing a file or data object to upload, or by utilizing the
 -URLSession:task:needNewBodyStream: delegate message to supply an upload
 body.
 
 An URLSessionDownloadTask will directly write the response data to
 a temporary file.  When completed, the delegate is sent
 URLSession:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingToURL: and given an opportunity
 to move this file to a permanent location in its sandboxed container, or to
 otherwise read the file. If canceled, an URLSessionDownloadTask can
 produce a data blob that can be used to resume a download at a later
 time.
 
 Beginning with iOS 9 and Mac OS X 10.11, URLSessionStream is
 available as a task type.  This allows for direct TCP/IP connection
 to a given host and port with optional secure handshaking and
 navigation of proxies.  Data tasks may also be upgraded to a
 URLSessionStream task via the HTTP Upgrade: header and appropriate
 use of the pipelining option of URLSessionConfiguration.  See RFC
 2817 and RFC 6455 for information about the Upgrade: header, and
 comments below on turning data tasks into stream tasks.
 */

/* DataTask objects receive the payload through zero or more delegate messages */
/* UploadTask objects receive periodic progress updates but do not return a body */
/* DownloadTask objects represent an active download to disk.  They can provide resume data when canceled. */
/* StreamTask objects may be used to create NSInput and OutputStreams, or used directly in reading and writing. */

/*
 
 URLSession is not available for i386 targets before Mac OS X 10.10.

/// # URLSession API implementation overview
///
/// ## Design Overview
///
/// This implementation uses libcurl for the HTTP layer implementation. At a
/// high level, the `URLSession` keeps a *multi handle*, and each
/// `URLSessionTask` has an *easy handle*. This way these two APIs somewhat
/// have a 1-to-1 mapping.
///
/// The `URLSessionTask` class is in charge of configuring its *easy handle*
/// and adding it to the owning session’s *multi handle*. Adding / removing
/// the handle effectively resumes / suspends the transfer.
///
/// The `URLSessionTask` class has subclasses, but this design puts all the
/// logic into the parent `URLSessionTask`.
///
/// Both the `URLSession` and `URLSessionTask` extensively use helper
/// types to ease testability, separate responsibilities, and improve
/// readability. These types are nested inside the `URLSession` and
/// `URLSessionTask` to limit their scope. Some of these even have sub-types.
///
/// The session class uses the `URLSession.TaskRegistry` to keep track of its
/// tasks.
///
/// The task class uses an `InternalState` type together with `TransferState` to
/// keep track of its state and each transfer’s state -- note that a single task
/// may do multiple transfers, e.g. as the result of a redirect.
///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// Most libcurl functions either return a `CURLcode` or `CURLMcode` which
/// are represented in Swift as `CFURLSessionEasyCode` and
/// `CFURLSessionMultiCode` respectively. We turn these functions into throwing
/// functions by appending `.asError()` onto their calls. This turns the error
/// code into `Void` but throws the error if it's not `.OK` / zero.
///
/// This is combined with `try!` is almost all places, because such an error
/// indicates a programming error. Hence the pattern used in this code is
///
/// ```
/// try! someFunction().asError()
/// ```
///
/// where `someFunction()` is a function that returns a `CFURLSessionEasyCode`.
///
/// ## Threading
///
/// The URLSession has a libdispatch ‘work queue’, and all internal work is
/// done on that queue, such that the code doesn't have to deal with thread
/// safety beyond that. All work inside a `URLSessionTask` will run on this
/// work queue, and so will code manipulating the session's *multi handle*.
///
/// Delegate callbacks are, however, done on the passed in
/// `delegateQueue`. And any calls into this API need to switch onto the ‘work
/// queue’ as needed.
///
/// - SeeAlso: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/threadsafe.html
/// - SeeAlso: URLSession+libcurl.swift
///
/// ## HTTP and RFC 2616
///
/// Most of HTTP is defined in [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616).
/// While libcurl handles many of these details, some are handled by this
/// URLSession implementation.
///
/// ## To Do
///
/// - TODO: Is is not clear if using API that takes a URLRequest will override
/// all settings of the URLSessionConfiguration or just those that have not
/// explicitly been set.
/// E.g. creating an URLRequest will cause it to have the default timeoutInterval
/// of 60 seconds, but should this be used in stead of the configuration's
/// timeoutIntervalForRequest even if the request's timeoutInterval has not
/// been set explicitly?
///
/// - TODO: We could re-use EasyHandles once they're complete. That'd be a
/// performance optimization. Not sure how much that'd help. The URLSession
/// would have to keep a pool of unused handles.
///
/// - TODO: Could make `workQueue` concurrent and use a multiple reader / single
/// writer approach if it turns out that there's contention.
