# Foundation

The Foundation framework defines a base layer of functionality that is required for almost all applications. It provides primitive classes and introduces several paradigms that define functionality not provided by either the Objective-C runtime and language or Swift standard library and language.

It is designed with these goals in mind:

* Provide a small set of basic utility classes and data structures.
* Make software development easier by introducing consistent conventions.
* Support internationalization and localization, to make software accessible to users around the world.
* Provide a level of OS independence, to enhance portability.

There is more information on the Foundation framework [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/ObjC_classic/).

This project, `swift-corelibs-foundation`, provides a compatibility implementation of the Foundation API for platforms where there is no Objective-C runtime. On macOS, iOS, and other Apple platforms, apps should use the Foundation that comes with the operating system.

## Project Navigator

Foundation builds in different configurations and is composed of several projects.

### Swift Foundation

A shared library shipped in the Swift toolchain, written in Swift. It provides the core implementation of many key types, including `URL`, `Data`, `JSONDecoder`, `Locale`, `Calendar`, and more in the `FoundationEssentials` and `FoundationInternationalization` modules. Its source code is shared across all platforms.

_swift-foundation_ depends on a limited set of packages, primarily [swift-collections](http://github.com/apple/swift-collections) and [swift-syntax](http://github.com/apple/swift-syntax).

### Swift Corelibs Foundation

A shared library shipped in the Swift toolchain. It provides compatibility API for clients that need pre-Swift API from Foundation. It is written in Swift and C. It provides, among other types, `NSObject`, class-based data structures, `NSFormatter`, and `NSKeyedArchiver`. It re-exports the `FoundationEssentials` and `FoundationInternationalization` modules, allowing compatibility for source written before the introduction of the _swift-foundation_ project. As these implementations are distinct from those written in Objective-C, the compatibility is best-effort only.

_swift-corelibs-foundation_ builds for non-Darwin platforms only. It installs the `Foundation` umbrella module, `FoundationXML`, and `FoundationNetworking`.

### Foundation ICU

A private library for Foundation, wrapping ICU. Using a standard version of ICU provides stability in the behavior of our internationalization API, and consistency with the latest releases on Darwin platforms. It is imported from the `FoundationInternationalization` module only. Clients that do not need API that relies upon the data provided by ICU can import `FoundationEssentials` instead.

### Foundation Framework

A [framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Frameworks.html) built into macOS, iOS, and all other Darwin platforms. It is written in a combination of C, Objective-C, and Swift. The Foundation framework compiles the sources from _swift-foundation_ into its binary and provides one `Foundation` module that contains all features.


## Using Foundation

Here is a simple `main.swift` file which uses Foundation. This guide assumes you have already installed a version of the latest [Swift binary distribution](https://swift.org/download/#latest-development-snapshots).

```swift
import Foundation

// Make a URLComponents instance
let swifty = URLComponents(string: "https://swift.org")!

// Print something useful about the URL
print("\(swifty.host!)")

// Output: "swift.org"
```

You will want to use the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) to build your Swift apps.

## Working on Foundation

swift-corelibs-foundation builds as a standalone project using Swift Package Manager. Simply use `swift build` in the root of the checkout to build the project.

swift-corelibs-foundation also builds as part of the toolchain for non-Darwin platforms. Instructions on building the toolchain are available in the [Swift project](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift?tab=readme-ov-file#building).

## Contributions

We welcome contributions to Foundation! Please see the [known issues](Docs/Issues.md) page if you are looking for an area where we need help. We are also standing by on the [mailing lists](https://swift.org/community/#communication) to answer questions about what is most important to do and what we will accept into the project.
